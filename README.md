## Games Using Socket
In this project, I have developed simple games like tic-tac-toe using React and JavaScript, integrating React Router to navigate between different game views. Socket.IO is used to enable multiplayer functionality and real-time chatting within game rooms, providing an interactive and engaging user experience.

## Reason Behind This Project
This project was created as a learning resource to explore and understand the capabilities of Socket.IO in handling real-time communication and dynamic user interactions. It demonstrates the implementation of various logic required to build multiplayer games with integrated chat features.

## Clone the project
+ For cloning: 
`git clone https://github.com/saksham-malhotra-27/Socket-tictactoe`
+ Then go to backend directory and install dependencies.
```
cd Socket-tictactoe/backend
npm i
npm run start
```
+ Then go to frontend directory and install dependencies.
`cd Socket-tictactoe/frontend`
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

## Features
### Multiplayer Gaming: 
Users can create or join game rooms and play against each other in real time.
### Real-time Chat: 
Players can chat with each other within the game room, enhancing the social interaction aspect of the games.
### React Router Integration:
Smooth navigation between different game views and rooms.
### Interactive UI: 
User-friendly and responsive interface developed using React.

## Learning Outcomes
+ Gained hands-on experience with Socket.IO and its integration with React.
+ Learned to manage real-time communication between multiple clients.
+ Improved understanding of React Router for navigating between different views in a single-page application.
+ Enhanced skills in developing interactive and responsive user interfaces.
